Welcome to my Power BI project portfolio! As an aspiring business analyst, I’ve used this space to showcase real-world dashboards and data stories that demonstrate my skills in data visualization, business insights, and decision-making using Power BI.

Each project dives into a unique dataset and explores key trends, metrics, and visuals, reflecting both my technical proficiency and analytical mindset.
